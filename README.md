# Sequence Planner
Sequence Planner is a control infrastructure for ROS2 written in rust. SP is as a control system for intelligent automation including multiple robots and operators.

Soon, a tutorial and some example will be located in this repository. For now, one example is located in https://github.com/sequenceplanner/dorna_example. The core part of SP is located in https://github.com/sequenceplanner/sp-rust. 

We have also developed a ROS2 rust library, that you can find in https://github.com/sequenceplanner/r2r
