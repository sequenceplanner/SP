# Sequence Planner
Sequence Planner is a control infrastructure for ROS2 written in rust. SP is used for deliberative automation including multiple robots and operators and is based on automated planning.

Soon, Sequence Planner (SP) including some example will be located in this repository. For now, one example is located in https://github.com/sequenceplanner/dorna_example. The core part of SP is located in https://github.com/sequenceplanner/sp-rust. 

We have also developed a ROS2 rust library, that you can find in https://github.com/sequenceplanner/r2r
